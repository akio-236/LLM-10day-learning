Day 1: Basics of LLMs
Topics to Cover:
What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models trained on extensive text data to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
Examples: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
Core Architecture: Transformers.
Key Concepts:

Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller components (tokens) like words, subwords, or characters.
Embeddings: Representing tokens numerically in a continuous vector space.
Attention Mechanisms: Allow models to focus on relevant parts of input data while processing.
Practical Steps for Day 1
1. Understanding Transformer Architecture
Paper: Attention Is All You Need.
Concept: Transformers use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of input sequences.
